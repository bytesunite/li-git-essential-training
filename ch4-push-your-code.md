# Chapter 4 - Push Your Code with Git

## Set up a remote repository
A *remote repository* is a repository setup an a Git provider, such as GitHub.
There are several well known Git providers
- GitHub
- GitLab
- Bitbucket

The course examples focus on *GitHub* and *GitHub Codespace*.

If you don't have a GitHub account, create one, it's free & requires an email address to get started.

To create a new repository you can navigate to `https://github.com/new` or by going to your list of repositories and click the green "New" button.
To get to a list of your repositories for you GitHub account, click the account icon in the top right, then select "Your repositories".

When creating a new repository you need to fill in a few details and GitHub provides an online form to make this fairly easy.<br>
The demonstration creates a private repository with a name "git-repository", and chooses to have a README created. 

- The name of the repository<br>
  GitHub will let you know if the given name is available.
  Since this name will be part of the url, avoid spaces.<br>
  EX: git-repository
- (optional) description
- visibility<br>
  You have two choices (public/private)<br>
  Public means anyone can view it but not edit it.<br>
  Private is only visible to you.
- initialize<br>
  Adding a README file is a good practice<br>
  Other choices are optional but a MIT license is good for opensource

After picking and choosing the details of the repository click the *Create Repository* button.
