# Chapter 3 - Install and Configure Git

## Use a Codespace For This Course
The instructor shows how to fork a Codespace to help mirror the environment and making it easier to follow along using the same settings the instructor has.
CodeSpaces is an online environment rather than working on your local computer.
It even provides access to an online version of VSCode in the browser.

To use CodeSpaces you are going to create a fork of the LinkedIn Learning repository.

GitHub repository [git-essential-training-5988161](https://github.com/linkedInLearning/git-essential-training-5988161)


1. Open a web browser and go to the GitHub repository above. 
2. Click on the green *Code* button and select the *Codespaces* tab.
3. Click on the green button *Create codespace on main*<br>
   This will open an editor for you within the browser window.

To view and delete a Codespace you may have to refresh the screen but you can click on the green *Code* button and go to the *Codespaces* tab and see a list of them. The three small dots to the right of the name opens a small window with the option to delete the Codespace.
